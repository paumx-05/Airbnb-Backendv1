I need to access the documentation in the @AirBnb-Backend/ directory to create the milestone1.md for the backend. However, I don't see any files uploaded or specific documentation provided.
Based on your requirements, here's what I understand as the Product Owner for creating the backend milestone:
Important Requirements List:
Project Scope & Complexity

Maximum 5 steps for milestone completion
Junior-level complexity - simple and understandable code
Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions lightweight
Scalable and simple code architecture

Technology Stack

MongoDB - Database
Express.js - Web framework
TypeScript - Programming language
Functional programming preferred over classes/objects
MVC architecture pattern implementation

API Standards

All routes must comply with REST API standards
Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Consistent endpoint naming conventions

Development Approach

Install only necessary dependencies
Lightweight and scalable solutions
Functional programming paradigm
Clear separation of concerns (Model-View-Controller)

Could you please provide access to the documentation in the @AirBnb-Backend/ directory? I need to review the existing documentation to create an appropriate milestone1.md that aligns with the project's current state and requirements.
Once I have access to the documentation, I'll create a structured milestone1.md with:

Clear objectives
Specific deliverables
Technical requirements
Implementation steps (max 5)
Acceptance criteria
